## Phase 3 — Polish (Apr 6–10)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| P-1 | End-to-end demo script (ingest → serve → ask → export) | ⬜ Not started | |
| P-2 | README polish (value prop, setup, prerequisites, demo) | ⬜ Not started | Ollama + Cacten install steps |
| P-3 | CLI help text audit (all commands) | ⬜ Not started | |
| P-4 | Ingest performance pass | ✅ Done | Profiled large-corpus ingest; Ollama embedding is the main bottleneck. Batched embedding + streamed upserts landed, and follow-up optimizations are documented. |
| P-5 | Incremental ingest | ✅ Done | File hashes, per-version file manifests, unchanged-file reuse, and sparse encoder version invalidation implemented. |
| P-6 | Cross-encoder reranker | ✅ Done | FastEmbed/ONNX reranker integrated after hybrid retrieval with fallback behavior. |
| P-7 | mypy strict pass — clean across all modules | ✅ Done | `uv run mypy src` passes cleanly. |
| P-8 | Final test coverage pass | ✅ Done | `uv run pytest` passes; core ingestion, retrieval, rerank, versions, and store paths covered. |
| P-9 | Design docs final review | ⬜ Not started | |
| P-10 | Git repo init + initial push | ⬜ Not started | |

## Phase 4 — Eval Integration (Apr 13–17)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-1 | Resolve Q7: validate SessionLog schema against Eval Studio ingestion contract | ⬜ Not started | Must be done before E-2 |
| E-2 | `cacten evals export` command (session logs → JSON array for jt-eval-kit) | ⬜ Not started | `--output`, `--since`, `--kb-version`, `--limit` flags |
| E-3 | Eval Studio ingestion smoke test | ⬜ Not started | End-to-end validation |
| E-4 | Document eval workflow in README | ⬜ Not started | ingest → ask → export → eval |

## Backlog (Post-v1)

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BL-1 | Reranker quality tuning | FastEmbed/ONNX reranker is implemented; tune candidate count/model choice with evals. |
| BL-2 | Contextual Retrieval (Anthropic, 2025) | LLM-prepended context summaries per chunk before embedding — one of the highest-ROI v2 upgrades |
| BL-3 | HyDE query expansion | Generate hypothetical answer, embed it, use for retrieval — strong fit for short/vague dev queries |
| BL-4 | Content-type chunking routing | PDFs → page-level, code → function-aware, markdown → structure-aware |
| BL-5 | HTTP MCP transport | Switch from stdio for shared/remote use or web UI |
| BL-6 | VS Code plugin | Wraps the CLI |
| BL-7 | GitHub repo ingestion | Direct repo ingest without manual file upload |
| BL-8 | Source-document-level erasure | `cacten ingest remove ./doc.md --rebuild-version` |
| BL-9 | Web UI for KB management | Ingestion history, version browser |
| BL-10 | Multi-developer support | Isolated KBs per developer |
| BL-11 | Medium article — Cacten | Write after v1 ships |
